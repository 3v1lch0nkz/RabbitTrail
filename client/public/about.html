  <h1>About RabbitTrail</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      RabbitTrail is dedicated to empowering curious minds with collaborative tools for exploration and discovery. We believe in the power of shared knowledge and visual storytelling to make sense of complex information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide a platform where investigators, researchers, journalists, and hobbyists can document, organize, and share their discoveries in an intuitive, map-based environment.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      RabbitTrail began in 2023 when a group of developers, journalists, and investigation enthusiasts recognized a common problem: the difficulty of organizing complex information across multiple sources, locations, and timelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional investigation tools were either too complex for casual users or too simplistic for meaningful collaborative work. There was a gap in the market for a tool that combined powerful mapping and documentation capabilities with an intuitive interface accessible to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      After months of development and user testing, RabbitTrail was launched with a vision to democratize investigation tools and make collaborative research more accessible to everyone with a curious mind.
