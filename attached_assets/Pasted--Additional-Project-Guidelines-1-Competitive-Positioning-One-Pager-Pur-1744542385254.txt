## 1. 🧭 Competitive Positioning One-Pager

### Purpose
To clarify where this app stands in the landscape of investigative and mapping tools.

### Key Points:
- **Target Users**: Hobbyist investigators, mystery solvers, map-data geeks.
- **Competitors**:
  - Reddit communities (r/UnresolvedMysteries, r/TrueCrime)
  - Google My Maps (limited collaboration, not designed for investigation)
  - Obsidian + plugins (note-based, no mapping UI)
  - ArcGIS StoryMaps (too academic/corporate)
- **Our Advantage**:
  - Purpose-built for intuitive investigative mapping
  - Vibe-first UX — fun, curious, slightly conspiratorial
  - Mobile/desktop parity
  - Collaboration with minimal friction
  - Rich entries with multimedia and geolocation

### Q: Who is this for?
A: Amateur sleuths, hobbyist case trackers, armchair detectives, and curious data wranglers.

### Q: Is this just for true crime?
A: Nope — it can be used for mystery spots, urban legends, folklore, or just tracking weird events in your area.

### Q: Can I share a project with my friends?
A: Yes! You can invite collaborators via email or generate a shareable link with edit access.

### Q: Do I need to know coding?
A: Not at all. It’s all visual and designed for regular users.

### Q: Will my entries be private?
A: By default, yes. Only shared projects are visible to others.
